CyberPatriot is a national youth cyber education program created in the United States to help direct students toward careers in cybersecurity or other computer science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines.[1][2] The program was created by the Air Force Association (AFA).[3] It features the annual National Youth Cyber Defense Competition for high and middle school students. It is similar to its collegiate counterpart, the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC).

CyberPatriot requires teams to assume the role of cybersecurity professionals, responsible for protecting various systems in a set amount of time. The competition consists of multiple online rounds in which teams analyze virtual machines, identify vulnerabilities, and implement security measures, answer forensics questions, and secure critical services. The Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security (CIAS) is responsible for designing, developing, and supplying the technology and virtual machines used in CyberPatriot.[4] The competition assesses participants' cybersecurity knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and analytical thinking.[5]

The National Youth Cyber Defense Competition is now in its seventeenth season and is called "CyberPatriot XVII" indicating the season's competition. CyberPatriot XVII is accessible to high schools, middle schools, and accredited homeschooling programs across the United States. JROTC units of all Services, Civil Air Patrol squadrons, and Naval Sea Cadet Corps divisions may also participate in the competition. CyberPatriot also hosts two additional sub-programs: Summer CyberCamps[6] and an Elementary School Cyber Education Initiative.[7] The Northrop Grumman Foundation is the "presenting sponsor". A British spin off program is called Cyber Centurion.

History
CyberPatriot began in 2009 as a proof-of-concept demonstration at AFA's Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando, Florida.[8] Four organizations were responsible for developing the competition: the Air Force Association, the U.S. Air Force, the defense contractor SAIC, and the Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security (CIAS) at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). Eight high school teams from AFJROTC and Civil Air Patrol squadrons competed. The second phase of the program was limited to Air Force AFJROTC and Civil Air Patrol teams. Online training and qualification competitions were held during the fall of 2009 with nearly 200 teams from 44 states competing for eight slots in the first in-person National Finals Competition in February 2010, held in Orlando, Florida. The final phase of the developmental program, full national deployment, is now underway. Over 1,500 teams from all 50 states, Canada, and DoD Dependent schools overseas competed in CyberPatriot VI.[9] CyberPatriot VII began in October 2014, with over 2,100 teams registered to compete.[10] The Middle School Division was added in CyberPatriot V. CyberPatriot IX, which started in October 2016, featuring over 4,300 registered teams.[11] The previous national commissioner who had served in that position since 2008, General Bernie Skoch, then the long-time National Comissioner, retired in June 2021, and has been replaced by Acting National Commissioner Rachel Zimmerman, who has served in other leadership roles prior to her term as commissioner.

Goals and objectives
CyberPatriot is open to high school and middle school students, offering educational opportunities and a pathway to cybersecurity careers. The program increases the awareness of cybersecurity by delivering a basic education in a competitive format that enhances leadership, communication, and cooperation skills among its competitors.[12][13][14]

Classic CyberPatriot Logo (Full-Color) (Still used today in some materials, used mainly in the past mostly, most notably on CyberPatriot website)
The full-color version of the CyberPatriot logo. While primarily used in earlier materials, continues to appear in select current publications, including on the official CyberPatriot website.
Team Composition
Teams have the following members:

Coach: An approved adult leader—such as a teacher, parent, or designated supervisor—who completes the team's registration and provides oversight throughout the competition period.
Verification Official: An administrator from the participating organization who is responsible for confirming the Coach’s eligibility and approval in accordance with program requirements.
Competitors: A group of two to six students, consisting of up to five primary competitors and one alternate, who participate in the competition and complete all assigned tasks.
Technical Mentor (optional): A qualified adult volunteer who possesses technical expertise and supports the team’s preparation by offering guidance in cybersecurity concepts and competition-related skills.
Team Assistant (optional): An individual who aids the Coach with administrative duties related to team management and logistics throughout the competition season.
Each team is required to have a registered Coach, a Verification Official, and registered Competitors. Coach registration begins in the late spring to allow preparation over the summer. The qualification rounds of the competition are completed online at the teams' home locations from September to early January.[15]

Competition guidelines
The competition is a tournament structure with three divisions:

Open High School Division: Open to all public, private, parochial, magnet, charter, home schools, and special groups such as CampFire, Boys & Girls Club, Boy Scouts, Church Youth Groups, Girl Scouts, etc.
All-Service Division: Open to all JROTC Services, Civil Air Patrol squadrons, US Naval Sea Cadet Corps units. The registration fee is waived for teams competing in the All-Service Division
Middle School Division: Open to all middle schools and junior high schools which follow the same common organizations as mentioned above in the Open High School Division.
The early rounds of the competition are done online during weekends via the Internet from teams' schools or other sponsoring organizations' facilities. Before the round, teams download virtual images of operating systems with known flaws or cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each team is tasked to find the flaws while keeping specified computer functions, such as email, working. Team progress is recorded by a central CyberPatriot scoring system, known as the CyberPatriot Competition System (CCS).[16]

The scores from Qualification Rounds 1 and 2 are totaled to determine which tier a team advances to.

Platinum: Top 30% of teams. Rounds include State, Semifinals, and National Finals.
Gold: Middle 40% of teams. Rounds include State and Semifinals.
Silver: Bottom 30% of teams. Rounds include State and Semifinals.
In the Semifinals round, only the top 25% of teams and state wild cards will be eligible to compete. Only teams in the Platinum tier are eligible for the National Finals.

In CyberPatriot XIII, only three rounds were held, with Round 1 delayed due to COVID-19 to allow coaches additional time for recruitment, according to announcements from the Air Force Association. Round 3 determined the National Finalists teams that year.[17]

The Challenges that teams may face include:

Network Security Challenge, in which teams fix vulnerabilities in "images" of Operating Systems that have been purposely tampered with, During Nationals, competitors also must protect the virtual machines(VMs) from "Red Team" which is a group of "hackers" that will exploit vulnerabilities on the competitor's machines. The Operating Systems in CP-XVII include: Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022, Ubuntu 22, and Mint 21.
Cisco Networking Challenge, in which teams show their knowledge about Cisco Packet Tracer, and take a Cisco quiz.
CyberPatriot Web-Based Challenge, in which competitors compete in a CTF-like challenge. This challenge is currently only in the Semifinals Round.
Boeing Cyber-Physical System Challenge, in which teams are presented with an operational system that tracks and maintains flight information. This challenge is currently only in the Semifinals Round.[18][19][20]
Additional competition rules are outlined below:

The Qualification Competition begins as soon as this image is opened and ends 4 consecutive hours later, after which the score will be logged. Attempting to continue after the time limit will incur penalties. It is the coach's responsibility to ensure their team does not exceed the limit.
Only one instance of the image can be opened at any given time. Opening multiple instances of a virtual image will result in a penalty.
No person may compete on a team with which they are not registered, and may only be registered with one team per competition.
During the competition, no outside assistance may be given to or received from anyone.
No competitor may offer assistance to another after their round ends and the other begins.
No outside communication is allowed during the competition. This includes but is not limited to verbal, electronic, written or coded.
No offensive activity of any kind is permitted, including but not limited to hacking through programs or manual code injection, interfering with another team through social engineering, deception, and/or attaining the opposing machine.[15]
National Finals Competition
The highest-scoring Semifinalist teams from each division, about 28 in total, are invited to participate in the in-person National Finals Competition. This is held annually in the spring, with all travel and lodging expenses covered by the program. For CyberPatriot IV-VII, National Finals Competitions were held at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland in March. From the CyberPatriot VIII season through the CyberPatriot XI season, the National Finals Competitions moved to the Hyatt Regency Baltimore Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland, and were held in April of each year. Beginning in the CyberPatriot XII season, the National Finals Competition has been held at the Bethesda North Marriott Hotel & Conference Center in Bethesda, Maryland outside of Washington, D.C., in March. However, the CyberPatriot XII In-Person National Finals Competition, the first year planned at the Bethesda North Marriott, was canceled due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and a virtual, in-home competition was held online in May, about two months after the originally scheduled in-person competition event.[21] The CP-XII Virtual National Finals was held on May 2, 2020, and marked the first-ever online virtual CyberPatriot National Finals Competition. Due to the widespread outbreak of COVID-19, the CyberPatriot XIII season had modifications to accommodate the delay in team administration as well as provisions for additional procedures for competing at home. Due to continued COVID-19 restrictions in the United States, provisions were made to allow remote participation in the competition, and the National Finals that season, in 2021, was also held virtually, in which competitions competed fully remotely online.

Winning teams in the Open and All-Service Divisions receive educational grants, which can be applied to an institution of their choosing. First place teams earn $2,000 per competitor, second place teams earn $1,500 per competitor, and third place earns $1,000 per competitor. The scholarship money is provided by the Northrop Grumman Foundation. In CyberPatriot VII, for first, second, and third place, an additional $2,000, $1,500, and $1,000 were awarded to the teams, respectively, by the National Security Agency

Notes
 Unless otherwise cited, information is sourced from the CyberSentinel, AFA's CyberPatriot newsletter. Team and coach details are primarily taken from the National Finals (Special) Editions, which may or may not be specially labeled, typically released before the National Finals Competition, often in March or April, usually depending on the exact dates and timing of the National Finals Competition event, or from the official National Finals Program Publication for each season. For CP-XII 2020 and future seasons, the National Finals edition of The CyberSentinel may be unavailable or may omit coach and team member names. In such cases, names are sourced from the National Finals Program, if available. The winning team is verified using official sources such as AFA press releases, subsequent newsletter issues, or the Competition History pages listing winners by division. After the official release of results, the verified winning team is matched to listings in the pre-competition publications to identify the coach and team members. It is important to note that the oldest issue of the CyberSentinel dates back to January 2012, during the CyberPatriot IV (2011-2012) Season before the National Finals Competition, and thus information from earlier seasons is not available from The CyberSentinel. Team members are listed in the order as it appears on the CyberSentinel or an available external source. The National Finals CyberSentinel for the CyberPatriot XI (2018-2019) season for the 2019 National Finals Competition did not list coaches for the teams.
Important Note Regarding the CyberPatriot XII (2019-2020) and Onward Seasons: The in-person CyberPatriot XII (2020) National Finals Competition was canceled due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and was shifted to an online competition. Thus, the National Finals CyberSentinel for this season is not available or has been removed. However, the National Finals Program brochure magazine was prepared before the cancelation and was still distributed digitally and physically before, during, and after the rescheduled virtual competition event. Consequently, team information for that season have been obtained from the above-mentioned official AFA CyberPatriot XII 2020 National Finals Competition Program publication, which is available the link here. For CyberPatriot XIII (2020–2021) and following seasons, including both during the continuation of virtual National Finals and after the resumption of regular in-person National Finals Competition events in 2022 (CP-XIV), regular CyberSentinel publication resumed, but did not list team details, including coaches and team members. Therefor, this information was obtained from the corresponding National Finals Program (which was also published for the CyberPatriot-XIII (2020-2021) 2021 Virtual National Finals Competition event) instead starting from the CyberPatriot XII (2019-2020) season and onward. The National Finals program is typically published every season before the National Finals competition event but the information of the champion teams is retrieved from and verified against it post-event, after the champions have been announced and confirmed.
 Open Division (Non-Service Affiliated) teams were introduced in 2010. The first season with Open Division was CyberPatriot III (2010-2011).
 Poway Unified School District (PUSD/Poway USD), Oak Valley Middle School (OVMS), Del Norte High School (DNHS), Design39Campus (D39C), and/or any combination of the above-listed entities, district and/or school(s) all are under PUSD, did not allow the CyberAegis team to continue to be affiliated with them after the CyberPatriot XVI (2023-2024) season and effective before or at the start of the CyberPatriot XVII (2024-2025) season; so a switch was made to be affiliated and categorized under Scouting America (under its San Diego-Imperial Council)'s Exploring Program as Post 2928 (for High School/Open Division) and Club 2927 and Club 2929 (for Middle School. This is a change in name/affiliation, and thus the team members are still predominately from the above-named schools and area, and the membership and the membership, including coaches, mentors, helpers, organizers, assistants, other people involved, the organization/club/program structure, and the student body, is unchanged

Start of CyberPatriot FAQ from CyberPatriot Website---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Competition Round FAQ
​Coach Responsibilities
Do I have to be present during the round? Can my mentor fill in for me?
YES. Coaches must be present to monitor their students during a round of competition and ensure all competition rules are being followed. 
If you need your mentor or another adult to take over coaching duties for one round, you can submit a request for an alternate coach.

How do I request an alternate coach (for one round only)?
If a coach is unable to perform their duties, they may designate a coach alternate for one round only. To request a coach alternate for the round, complete the Coach Alternate Request Form prior to the start of the round. 

How do I request a permanent coaching change?
If you are no longer available to fulfill your duties as coach, you may transfer the responsibility to another qualified adult. To request the change, email info@uscyberpatriot.org with subject line: Coach Change Request. Include in the email your name, email address and the team number(s) (xx-xxxx) that you wish to transfer. Also include the name and email address of the individual who will be taking over as coach. 

The new coach must create a volunteer account or already have an existing account with CyberPatriot before the transfer can be processed. The change of coach will need to be approved by the verification official for the team.

My team can’t compete during the scheduled round. What should I do? 
There are no scheduled backup dates in CyberPatriot. The emergency competition date is for emergencies as stated in the Rules Book. All requests must be submitted via the Emergency Competition Date Appeal Form by 4:00 PM ET on the Tuesday following the scheduled competition round. Schedule conflicts will not be considered for the Emergency Competition Date.


Virtual Image Distribution Information
I didn’t receive the image download (or StartEx) email.
The image download email is typically sent on the Friday or Monday prior to the competition round start date. The StartEx email is sent at the start of the round (Thursday @ 9:00 AM ET).  A copy of the StartEx email will also be made available on the coach dashboard at the start of the round. If you have trouble locating the information, contact info@uscyberpatriot.org to request a resend. Include your team numbers (16-xxxx) in the body of the email. 

​Can I use cloud hosting to distribute images?
NO. Please DO NOT use vSphere or cloud hosting to distribute your images during any rounds of competition. Doing so may use up the limited number of license keys we have available and may disrupt the facilitation of the competition for all teams.

Can I send the images to competitors participating virtually? 
Yes, you may share the download links with virtual competitors; however, coaches must control the round images and passwords and ensure their proper use by persons known to them. Teams from the same school or organization CANNOT collaborate or share information from the images or Cisco Networking Challenge with each other or any other team.
If necessary, coaches and mentors can walk through the download steps with team members by safely using WebEx, Zoom or conference call. 
Coaches must ensure every team member deletes the images at the end of the round.


Scoring, Penalty, and Advancement Information
Where can I see my team’s score during the round? 
A public scoreboard is available during online rounds at scoreboard.uscyberpatriot.org. You can also view your team’s score on the Scoring Report available in the images (desktop icon).

I have a JavaScript error on my scoring report. What does that mean?
JavaScript is required for some error messages that appear on the CyberPatriot Scoring Report. To ensure that you only receive appropriate error messages, please do not disable JavaScript on any of the images.

Why am I seeing an Overtime Penalty?
A team’s 4-hour competition window begins the moment they open the first virtual image in VMware. If you open an image before your planned competition time, your time begins. If you re-open the image later, you’ll see on the scoring report that the clock has been running, and your four hours may already be expired.

What is a multiple instance penalty? 
During a competition round, no more than a single copy of the same virtual image may be opened at the same time. For example, if you are running the Windows 10 images on Computer 1 you cannot open a second copy of the Windows 10 image on Computer 2 or 3. See the example below:


​​
I’m having shutdown and Stop Scoring Button issues.
There are certain image security settings that will cause the Stop Scoring Button to malfunction. In the event your team receives an error using the Stop Scoring Button, please shut down the image using the following steps below:

Click the Player drop-down
Click Power 
Click Shut Down Guest
Click “Yes” on the pop-up
Shutdown or restart the host computer and do not re-open the image or you may incur an overtime penalty. Please ensure the images are deleted at the end of each camp.

There is an issue with my score. Who should I contact? 
Score Correction Requests will only be accepted via the official Score Correction Request Form. The Score Correction Request Form allows coaches to self-report scoring discrepancies or issues during and immediately after the competition (until 11:59 PM ET on the last the day the round ends – Late requests are NOT accepted). Please do not email the CyberPatriot Program Office with documentation unless requested. 

Once the score correction requests are reviewed, coaches will receive an email with the preliminary scores. The email provides information about the Preliminary Score Discrepancy Form​, which is the last opportunity for coaches to request changes to their scores before the scores are finalized and made official. Technical issues and scoring issues such as not recieving points for a fix, image crashes, etc. will not be considered in the Preliminary Score Discrepancy Report form.

When / where are final scores published? 
Final scores are published on www.uscyberpatriot.org under Competition > Current Competition > Scores. It takes 7-10 business days after the end of the round for scores to be published. Coaches will be notified once the final scores are posted. Until then, please refrain from contacting us about when scores will be available.

How do I know what "Tier" my team is in?
Tier placement for high school teams (Open and All Service Division) is located on the published Round 2 Scores​ document. Middle School Division teams are not assigned a tier placement.

What teams advance to the Semifinal Round?
Open Division - Within each tier, the top 25% of teams (based on State Round score) advance to the Semifinal Round. If a US state, Canada, or the At-Large Region is not represented by ​any of the top 25% of teams, the highest scoring team from each of the unrepresented locations will advance as a wildcard team.
All Service Division - Within each tier, the top 25% of team (based on State Round score and regardless of category) advance to the Semifinal Round. The six highest scoring teams from each category must advance to the Semifinals. If one of a category’s six highest scoring teams does not advance as part of the highest 25% of their tier, then that team will advance as a Category Wild Card. 
​Middle School Division - The top 60% of teams (based on cumulative Introductory Round and State Round scores) advanced to the Semifinal Round.​

Image Troubleshooting 
Why won’t my image open? 
If an image that has a correct MD5 checksum does not open, you may try the following:

Verify the file name at the top of the VMware Workstation Player is correct. 
Verify that the file is not a zipped file by opening the unzipped image from the VMware Workstation Player. This is a common error.
Ensure virtual extensions or Virtual Technology settings are enabled in the BIOS.
Remove and re-install VMware Workstation Player.
Open the image on a different computer. 

My unique identifier is not working
If you receive a message that your Unique Identifier is invalid, verify and re-enter it. To do this, click the Set Unique Identifier icon on the desktop and enter the full 12-digit UID as displayed on the coach dashboard.

What do I do if my image is frozen?
If an image appears frozen, does not score, or otherwise does not function properly, the user has three options:

Go back through your notes and reverse what may have caused the issue.
Stop working on the image and accept the current score.
Shutdown the image, remove it from the library in VMware Workstation Player as well as the unzipped copy from the folder it was in, and reboot the host computer.  Then unzip a new image, open the image in VMware Workstation Player, and start with a score of zero.

How can I restart an image?
If an image needs to be restarted (restored to the way it was before any changes were made):

Shut down image in VMware Workstation Player
Delete the image .vxm folder (the current version of the unzipped image folder) 
Extract a new copy of the image from the .zip file (the original image file download)
NOTE: If you open a new copy of the image, the score for the image will be reverted to zero. It is important to keep notes of changes that have been made to earn back easily and quickly the lost points.

Please note that 2025-26, this year, is CyberPatriot 18. The rule book is from CyberPatriot 17(XVII).
CyberPatriot has received many questions concerning the use of ChatGPT and other AI platforms
in the competition. There are no new rules limiting their use. However, the Rules Book applies to
ChatGPT and other AI platforms since they are a resource (see section 3012 | Allowable
Resources). Specifically, teams may not put questions from the competition into AI platforms.
