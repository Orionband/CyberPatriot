A letter from the National Commissioner
June 7, 2024
Welcome to the CyberPatriot 17 competition season and thank you for taking the time to review the
CyberPatriot 17 Rules Book.
In this document, you will find the NEW competition design that has different competition windows and
a FOUR-DAY competition rounds before the Semifinals. The changes to the competition windows
were based on data collected from the previous season. All registered CyberPatriot participants,
including coaches, technical mentors, team assistants, and competitors, are bound by the rules and
procedures published in this document. This document is in force until the release of the next signed
change or edition.
As always, special thanks to the coaches, technical mentors, and CyberPatriot staff who contributed
to the rules book. Their team-level insights and recommendations were fundamental to this
document’s development.
If the rules of the school or organization to which a team belongs are more restrictive than the
CyberPatriot rules, then the school’s or organization’s rules will take precedence.
Changes to this document will be posted on the CyberPatriot website and distributed via email to
CyberPatriot coaches.
Please submit recommendations for updates or changes to this document by email to the
CyberPatriot Program Office. Address the email to cpoc@uscyberpatriot.org with the subject “Rules
Book Recommendation.”
Sincerely,
Rachel Zimmerman
National Commissioner, CyberPatriot

Introduction
The mission of CyberPatriot is to inspire students toward careers in cybersecurity or other science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines critical to our nation's future through
fun and engaging programs designed for K-12 students. This document covers the rules and
procedures that govern the National Youth Cyber Defense Competition for high school and middle
school students.
The competition can only operate if all competitors, coaches, technical mentors, team assistants, and
staff adhere to the highest ethical standard. All are expected to behave according to the guiding
principles outlined in this Rules Book to ensure the competition’s success:
 Integrity – The foundations of the competition are the honesty and ethics of all those involved
in the program, especially in the absence of supervision.
 Service – All adults must put the well-being and education of the competitors ahead of their
own concerns in preparation for and during the CyberPatriot competition.
 Excellence – The competition pushes students to achieve their best, during the competition
and beyond.
Coaches, competitors, technical mentors, team assistants, and staff should all use the following
operating principles during all aspects of the competition:
 Competitor Safety and Protection – Since most competitors are minors, this MUST BE THE
TOP PRIORITY for all involved. It is the coach’s responsibility to ensure the safety and
protection of their team while involved in all CyberPatriot activities. They must create a safe
environment that protects from unauthorized individuals, ensure appropriate online activity,
and use suitably secure facilities. In the event that an incident occurs involving the protection
or safety of a competitor, the coach has an obligation to follow correct procedures to report the
incident to local authorities and to stop or mitigate the incident immediately.
 Fairness – No participant should attempt to gain or give an unfair competitive advantage to
any individual or team. Any questions or concerns regarding fairness should be directed to the
CyberPatriot Program Office immediately.
 Adherence to the Rules – Everyone should obey the rules and regulations outlined in this
document. Coaches are charged with ensuring that teams do not behave otherwise.
 Privacy – Participants’ personal information must be protected by those who have access to
it. The CyberPatriot Program Office Staff may publish participant names and photographs
when appropriate permission is obtained.
 Transparency – To ensure openness and honesty, staff and coaches shall engage in two-way
communication on competition matters that do not infringe upon fairness.
 Cyber Citizenship – The CyberPatriot competition teaches Internet ethics and safety and
defensive activities only. It is not a hacking competition, nor does it teach or tolerate hacking,
or any activity related to the unauthorized entry, use, or modification of a computer, system, or
network by a person, persons, or tools.

technical support for CyberPatriot online competitions. It is only established during scheduled
competition windows and may be reached via the WebEx Tech Support Chat or by phone at 877-885-
5716. In addition to the CyberPatriot Program Office Staff, the CPOC is staffed by temporary staff
during the peak hours of competition activity.
1002 | Competition Divisions
CyberPatriot teams are divided into three divisions, as defined below. Each of these divisions is
independent of the others; teams in one division do not directly compete against teams in other
divisions. Unless otherwise specified, rules and procedures apply equally to the teams in all divisions.
Teams shall remain in their assigned divisions once they have competed in a qualification Round
(unless there was an administrative error in the registration process – i.e., a JROTC team registered
as a regular high school team).
There is no limit to the number of teams an organization can host within a given division.
1. Open Division
All high school and senior high-level students may compete on an Open Division team, provided that
team is fielded by one of the approved organization types below:
Public school – Private school – Parochial school – Charter school – Magnet School – Home school –
Scouting unit – State-chartered virtual school – Boys and Girls Club – YMCA or YWCA center – Other
youth organizations (with approval from National Commissioner)
2. All Service Division
All high school and senior high-level students may compete on an All Service Division team, provided
that team is fielded by one of the approved organization types below, and that all competitors on the
team are official members of the organization:
8
Army JROTC – Navy JROTC and Coast Guard JROTC – Marine Corps JROTC – Air Force JROTC
and Space Force JROTC – US Naval Sea Cadet Corps – Civil Air Patrol
Each of the six organizations listed above is a “Category.” Categories factor into some awards and
advancement during elimination rounds. Air Force JROTC and Space Force JROTC are combined as
one category. Navy JROTC and Coast Guard JROTC are combined into one category.
3. Middle School Division
All middle school and junior high-level students may compete on a Middle School Division team,
provided that team is fielded by one of the approved organization types below:
Public school – Private school – Parochial school – Charter school – Magnet School – Home school –
Scouting unit – State-chartered virtual school – Boys and Girls Club – YMCA or YWCA center – Civil
Air Patrol – US Navy League Cadet Corps – Other youth organizations (with approval from National
Commissioner)
4. Other Organizations and Special Requests for Competition Divisions
The following special requests apply to teams in the Open, All Service, and Middle School divisions:
A. Other Organizations – At the discretion of the National Commissioner, other organizations may
field a team in the Open Division or Middle School Division. Requirements for participation are:
1. Charter and Youth Program – The organization shall have a charter that includes a youth
program for high school and/or middle school-level students.
2. Mission and Purpose – The organization’s mission and purpose shall be consistent with the
principles and values of the CyberPatriot Program and AFA.
3. Designated Official Leader – The organization shall have a leader who is accountable for the
organization and is authorized to designate adults to have unsupervised access to minors in
the organization.
4. Minor Protection Policy and Training – The organization shall have an official policy for the
protection and safety of minors.
5. Minor Protection Training Requirement – Mandatory and formal training shall be required for
adults who have unsupervised access to minors.
B. Composite Teams – The preference is for students to participate through the school or home
school through which they receive the majority of their education. However, the National
Commissioner may consider the creation of a composite Open Division team from more than one
fielding organization if:
1. The organizations’ sizes do not support a full CyberPatriot team.
2. The organizations are not fielding other CyberPatriot teams.
3. The competitors belong to a common legally recognized entity, such as a school district, nonprofit organization, or municipality.
4. U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps and Civil Air Patrol teams use the same procedures as All
Service Division teams to include concurrence from their organizations’ National Headquarters
CyberPatriot Representative.
Also, the National Commissioner may consider the creation of a composite Open Division, Civil Air
Patrol, or Naval Sea Cadet Corps team comprised of both middle school and high school competitors
if:
1. In the estimation of the coach, the organization’s size does not support the formation of a
viable Middle School Division team on its own.
9
2. No more than two middle school students will be registered to the team.
3. The competitors belong to a common legally recognized entity
4. The verification official for the team consents to the formation of a composite team.
5. It is the only age-based composite team for that organization.
These requirements must be met to request approval for a composite team, and do not guarantee the
National Commissioner will grant an exception.
1003 | Teams and Team Members
Teams are the basic groupings of CyberPatriot participants.
1. Team Composition (Members)
Coach Verification Official Competitors
Teacher, parent, or other approved
adult leader. Completed the team
registration and supervises the team
during competition. Sole point of
contact for competition-related
correspondence.
Organization administrator who
verifies that the coach is approved
by the organization to work
unsupervised with minors and has
completed required youth protection
training.
Student participants. Must be
2-6 students on a team. There
is no U.S. citizenship
requirement for any
CyberPatriot competition
participant
A. Required Members – Each team must consist of a coach, a one-time verification official, and at
least two competitors. A team without these roles filled is ineligible to compete.
B. Optional Members – Technical mentors and team assistants may be part of team but are not
required for participation. Technical mentors are recommended, as they can provide next-level
teaching of cybersecurity principles.
Technical Mentor Team Assistant
Adult volunteer that possesses the technical
knowledge to assist in teaching the
competition training
Adult volunteer who assists the team coach
with non-technical support (administrative
tasks)
Technical mentors and team assistants must have social security number (or Canadian
social insurance number) to undergo the required background check.
2. Team Member Roles Explained
A. Coach – CyberPatriot requires an adult to register as the official team coach before any students
are permitted to compete.
10
A team must have one (and only one) adult coach of record for each team. This is a non-negotiable
requirement. A single coach may coach up to five (5) teams and is responsible for the proper
supervision of all their teams during all CyberPatriot-related activities. Teams registered to a coach
may be from different organizations as long as the coach receives proper vetting from a verification
official at each organization. Coaches may assist other teams, but only as a registered technical
mentor or team assistant. Co- or assistant coach roles do not exist.
To be a coach, an individual must meet the following requirements:
1. Eligibility Requirements
 Adult over 18 years of age on or before the team registration deadline
 Not a competitor or high school-level student
 Not a member of the CyberPatriot Program Office
 Vetted and approved by a verification official
 Agrees to abide by the CyberPatriot Coaches’ Agreement and Standards of Conduct. (See
Appendix I and Appendix II)
2. Additional Requirements – Adults must meet the following requirements in addition to those
mentioned above if they fall into any of the cases below:
a. Employees of Sponsors, Development Partners, and AFA – An employee of a
CyberPatriot sponsor, development partner, or AFA shall receive consent from their
organization’s designated CyberPatriot representative before becoming a coach. Former
AFA CyberPatriot Program Office employees are not eligible to participate in the
competition for three years after the last day of their AFA employment.
b. Competition Volunteers and Temporary Staff – National Finals Competition volunteers
and Competition Administration Team members (e.g., Red, White, and Green Teams),
CPOC staff, and other volunteers may not coach, technical mentor, or otherwise assist a
CyberPatriot team during the season in which they are volunteering or for one year after
the last day of their involvement as a volunteer.
c. CAP or USNSCC members – These coaches must also meet the following requirements:
1) Senior member or adult leader in good standing with CAP or USNSCC
2) Completion of appropriate Cadet Protection Program Training (CPPT)
3) Chain-of-command authorization of unsupervised access to cadets who are minors
d. Home School Team Coaches – In areas where home schools are subject to a local
school board or other governmental oversight, coaches of home school teams must be
verified by a co-op official or a homeschool teacher who can be verified by a legally
recognized agency that accredits or otherwise approves home school programs. Coaches
of homeschool teams must also meet the following requirements:
1) Authorization by their regulating agency and the students’ parents to have
unsupervised access to team members who are minors.
2) Procurement and retaining of written and signed parental consent forms for
competitors for the entire season (see Appendix III).
3) Completion of a certified youth protection program such as the free Boy Scouts of
America’s Youth Protection Training at www.my.scouting.org. A trainee does not have
to be affiliated with Boy Scouts but must create an account to take the online training.
11
3. Responsibilities
a. Competitor Protection – Coach responsibility includes controlling access to minors in a
way that protects them, respects parental prerogatives, and follows legal requirements
during all competition training, events, and rounds. Additionally, coaches are:
1) Accountable for technical mentors and team assistant interactions with the competitors.
2) Responsible for competitor safety and protection during all competition training, events,
and rounds (see Appendix IV).
b. Competition Integrity – Fairness and integrity are key components of a successful
CyberPatriot competition. Coaches are charged with upholding these principles at the team
level during competition by ensuring that their competitors receive no outside assistance in
any form, including help from technical mentors and team assistants (see Chapter 3).
Coaches may continue to provide clarification of rules and permissible actions per this
document while their teams compete.
c. Official Point of Contact – Official team and competition-related CyberPatriot
correspondence is emailed only to coaches, who may disseminate it to their teams. It is
therefore essential that coaches monitor their email for up-to-date information and ensure
they can receive messages from the CyberPatriot Program Office through their chosen
email domains. The role of the official point of contact may not be delegated to a technical
mentor unless the technical mentor is appointed as a Coach Alternate (below). The coach
is the only person who may request changes or corrections to the team or competitor
information.
4. No Compensation – Coaches participate on a volunteer basis and do not receive
compensation from AFA. AFA has no position with respect to gifts received by our volunteers.
5. Coach Changes – If a coach is unavailable for a portion of the competition season, there are
two choices. If the period of unavailability is temporary, the coach can designate a coach
alternate to receive email and supervise during a round of competition. If the period of
unavailability is prolonged, the coach or verification official can initiate a coach of record
change.
a. Coach Alternate – The coach alternate is only to be used if the team’s coach of record
has a one-off scheduling conflict or emergency that prevents them from managing the
team during a specific round of competition. Coach Alternates are subject to CyberPatriot
Program Office approval on a case-by-case basis. Coach Alternates should also be vetted
and approved by the original coach’s verification official before CyberPatriot Program
Office approval. Coach alternates may only act as a coach for the approved round of
competition and not substitute for the coach during future competition rounds without going
through the approval process again. (See Appendix V for information on requesting a
coach alternate).
b. Coach of Record Change –If the coach of record is unable to supervise the team over
several competition rounds, they must contact the CyberPatriot Program Office to transfer
the team to another school or organization-approved adult for the remainder of the season.
(See Appendix V for information on requesting a coach change).
B. Verification Official – All coaches are required to be vetted and approved to work with minors by
a verification official.
12
 School-based teams, including JROTC teams, must be verified by a principal, assistant
principal, supervisor, or department head.
 CAP teams must be verified by a unit commander or deputy commander.
 USNSCC teams must be verified by their Regional National Headquarters Representative or
an officer higher in their chain of command.
 Scouting units and all other approved educational organizations must be verified by an
organization head or supervisor.
 Coaches cannot act as their own verification official.
Though not active members of a team, verification officials perform the following critical functions:
 Verify that a coach is approved by the organization to work unsupervised with minors and has
completed required youth protection training.
 Validate a coach’s status as a school employee, school district-approved volunteer, or person
with an approved relationship with the school or fielding organization.
 Immediately notify the CyberPatriot Program Office if facts or circumstances call into
question the fitness of a coach to continue to supervise competitors.
C. Competitors – A CyberPatriot team consists of two to six competitors, up to five of whom may
compete at a single time. Substitution of team members is at the coach’s discretion during the online
rounds of competition. A competitor may compete on only one team during a competition season. To
be a competitor, students must meet the following requirements.
1. Eligibility Requirements
a. Open Division
 Enrolled in a participating high school or senior high program (or equivalent if enrolled
in a school that does not make this distinction) or granted an exception by the National

 For teams competing as non-school-based teams, the competitors must have an
affiliation with the organization hosting the team.
2. Responsibilities of ALL Competitors – It is the responsibility of competitors to abide by the
CyberPatriot Competitor Code of Conduct (see Appendix VI). Competitors will also agree to
act ethically each time they log on to a competition image.
D. Technical Mentors – Technical mentors, also referred to as mentors, are optional (but
recommended) technical advisors. One or more registered mentors may be chosen by a coach to
assist with a CyberPatriot team. Mentors must register on the CyberPatriot website and must be
officially paired/linked with any teams they are assisting (after meeting all their requirements). There is
no limit to the number of teams a mentor may assist, and there is no limit to the number of mentors
assisting a single team.
1. Eligibility Requirements
 Adult over 18 years of age.
 Not a competitor or high school-level student.
 Must pass a CyberPatriot Program Office background investigation, which requires

teach hacking skills or offensive cyber tactics to competitors.
 Meets with a team or individual competitors only with the coach’s approval.
 Must be officially linked through the competition dashboard to the team(s) they are
assisting.
2. Suggested Responsibilities – There is no minimum time commitment for mentors. For
example, a mentor can volunteer on a guest lecture basis or commit to training a team
throughout the competition season. Suggested responsibilities include the following:
 Advising the team’s coach on skills status.
 Developing, with the coach’s guidance, a plan to teach cyber defense skills and ethics.
 Teaching and assisting competitors with cyber defense skills and ethics.
3. Coaches as Technical Mentors – A coach may be a technical mentor for other teams only if
they are also registered as a technical mentor. Coaches not registered as a mentor are
ineligible for mentor awards.
14
4. No Compensation – Technical mentor positions are voluntary and do not receive
compensation. AFA has no position with respect to gifts received by volunteers.
E. Team Assistants – Team assistants are adult team members who provide non-technical support
and encouragement to the team. Teams are not required to have team assistants. Team assistants
must register on the CyberPatriot website and must be officially paired/linked with any teams they are
assisting (after meeting all their requirements).
1. Eligibility Requirements
 Adult over 18 years of age.
 Not a competitor or high school-level student.
 Must pass a CyberPatriot Program Office background investigation, which requires
possession of a social security number or Canadian social insurance number.
CyberPatriot does not have access to any checks or clearances performed by other
organizations, so all team assistants must undergo background checks through AFA’s
contracted screening company, PeopleFacts, Inc. The CyberPatriot background check is
not a substitute for a school’s or organization’s background checks or personnel
screening processes.
 Agrees to abide by the CyberPatriot Standards of Conduct (see Appendix II)
 Meets with a team and individual competitors only with the coach’s approval.
 Must be officially linked through the competition dashboard to the team(s) they are
assisting.
2. Suggested Responsibilities – There is no minimum time commitment for team assistants.
Team assistant responsibilities vary by team, but sample responsibilities include helping with
competition setup, snacks, and transportation.
3. Coaches as Team Assistants – A coach may be a team assistant for other teams only if
they also registered as a team assistant.
4. No Compensation – Team assistant positions are voluntary and do not receive
compensation. AFA has no position with respect to gifts received by volunteers.
3. Team Identification
For official purposes, team identification is standardized to recognize teams, assign scores, maintain
anonymity, and avoid misunderstandings in communication.
A. Teams Identfiers (Credentials)
1. Team Numbers – Team numbers are assigned during registration and are the primary
means to identify a team for competition purposes, such as assigning scores. A team number
starts with the competition season number and then four-digit number (Example: 15-0001).
The team number will remain the same for the entire season.
2. Unique Identifiers and Login Credentials– After the team number is assigned, each team
is assigned a Unique Identifier for their competition images. Before each round, coaches may
locate their twelve-digit alphanumeric code used for validation with the CyberPatriot scoring
server on the coaches dashboard on the CyberPatriot website. Examples of NetAcad
15
Challenge login credentials will also be on the NetAcad account creation instructions. Unique
Identifiers and other login credentials will not be emailed to teams in competition emails.
3. Organization Name – The official name of teams belonging to a school, including JROTC
units, is the school name. The official name of other teams, such as CAP and USNSCC units,
is the organization name. Composite teams have an official name assigned by the authority
that approved their composition
4. Unofficial Names (Team Nickname) – Teams can create unofficial team nicknames to
identify themselves at any time. The names must be in good taste and are subject to veto by
the CyberPatriot Program Office. Team names are optional and will not be used to identify
teams officially. Coaches must ensure nicknames are appropriate and do not include prohacking or offensive language.
B. Anonymity – Teams will remain anonymous, except for their team number, and except for the
following situations where information related to a team’s performance (e.g., scores, rankings,
advancement) is published.
1. Exceptions during Online Rounds
 The team names and team numbers of the top scoring teams in each round may be listed
with their scores on the public scoreboard during a competition round.
 Teams that win an award or certificate during the State Round will have their official
name, team nickname, and coach name published by the CyberPatriot Program Office.
This information will not be associated with the team’s scores.
2. Exceptions during the National Finals Competition – Teams that advance to the National
Finals Competition have their official names, team nickname, coach name, and competitors’
names published. This information will not be associated with the team’s scores. This
information may be published in the following places:
 The CyberSentinel – CyberPatriot’s official newsletter
 CyberPatriot website (www.uscyberpatriot.org) and social media
 The National Finals Competition program
 Press releases
 Communications to sponsors and government officials
Teams winning awards at National Finals will have their official names, competitor names,
awards, and rankings published. Rankings for other National Finalists will not be published.

2001 | Volunteer Accounts
Volunteer accounts are required for any adult individual (18+) wishing to be a coach, technical
mentor, or team assistant for the CyberPatriot National Youth Cyber Defense Competition.
NOTE: Student competitors SHOULD NOT create volunteer accounts. They do not need one to
participate.
2002 | Coach Registration and Team Creation
Coach registration begins the team creation process. The individual who creates the team from their
volunteer account is automatically assigned as the coach of that team. This means only the individual
who plans on being the coach should create the team.
A. Creating Teams – An adult volunteer/coach can register up to five teams using the “Create Team”
option on their dashboard. Up to five (5) teams may be registered by one coach. These teams may be
from the same or different schools, organization, or divisions under, provided that:
1. The coach completed the “Create Team” form once per team (this requires completion of the
form up to five times for five separate teams).
2. The listed verification official is part of the organization the specific team is registered with
3. The verification official separately verifies the coach for each registered team, even when the
teams are registered under the same organization. (This requires a response for up to five
separate verification emails per coach)
B. Team Verification and Approval – When the team creation form is submitted, the listed
verification official will receive an email asking to verify the information provided (coach name,
organization name, etc.).
Once verified, the team enters a queue for final approval from the CyberPatriot Program Office. Once
approval is granted, the coach will receive an email with a statement of approval and additional
instructions about team fee payment and competitor registration.
Detailed team registration instructions and screenshots are available at
https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/Documents/Team%20Registration%20Instructions.pdf
C. Registration Deadline – Registration for CyberPatriot 17 XVII (2024-25) opened on April 1, 2024.
The deadline to register a team is October 2, 2024. That is the last date a coach can add a new team.
Teams have until the first Qualification Round to be verified and approved and until November 6,
2024, to pay the registration fee.

2003 | Technical Mentor and Team Assistant Registration
Volunteers may register as a technical mentor or team assistant prior to knowing what team they will
be working with (if any). They may support teams from a physical location or virtually. There is no
deadline for technical mentor or team assistant registrations.
A. Becoming a technical mentor or team assistant – To become a technical mentor or team
assistant, a volunteer must complete the two-step registration process.
1. Mentor Application – Complete the “Mentor Application” form on their dashboard.
18
2. Background Check – All technical mentors and team assistants are required to complete a
background check conducted by the CyberPatriot Program Office. CyberPatriot does not have
access to any checks or clearances performed by other organizations, so all technical mentors
and team assistants must undergo background checks through AFA’s contracted screening
company, PeopleFacts, Inc. The CyberPatriot background check is not a substitute for a
school’s or organization’s background checks or personnel screening processes.
C. Linking with a Team – Once the background check is processed and approved by the
CyberPatriot Program Office, the approved technical mentor or team assistant appears on a list that is
accessible by approved CyberPatriot teams. Coaches may contact or invite a volunteer to assist their
teams (using a Find Mentor option available to them on their dashboards). Technical mentors and
team assistants can also contact teams looking for assistance using the “Find Team” button on their
Volunteer Dashboard
1. Availability – Technical mentors and team assistants can add or remove themselves from the
viewable list by changing their availability status using the “Edit Profile” button on their
dashboard.
Additional instructions for registering as a technical mentor or team assistant are available at
https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/Documents/Mentor%20Registration%20Instructions.pdf .
2004 | Competitor Registration
Coaches must add their competitors to their online rosters no later than 11:59 PM ET on the schedule
competitor registration deadline. For CyberPatriot 17 the registration deadline is October 23, 2024. A
coach may only add competitors after the team is verified and approved.
A. Registering a competitor – From the “Options” drop-down menu on the dashboard, a coach
selects “Register Competitor." The competitor’s name, email address, and t-shirt size must be
provided.
1. Parental Approval – Coaches must check the box indicating they have received oral, written,
or tacit consent (through membership in a club, activity, or class) from the competitor’s parent
or guardian. The CyberPatriot Program Office does NOT need any record of this outside of the
check box. Parental consent forms do NOT need to be submitted to the CyberPatriot Program
Office. (See Appendix III if in need of a sample parental approval form)
B. Competitor Questionnaire – After a competitor is added to a roster, they are automatically
emailed a link to a short questionnaire. Completion of this questionnaire is strongly encouraged, but
not required. The questionnaire is designed to help the CyberPatriot Program collect demographic
information about participants. This information is for internal use only.

2005 | Team Registration Fees
1. Registration Fees
Registration is considered complete when its applicable fee has been paid (or waived by the
CyberPatriot Program Office). All teams are welcome to participate in the Exhibition, Training and
Practice Round without paying the registration fee. The registration fee is due for a team once they
compete in a competition Round (Round 1, Round 2, Introductory Round, State Round or Semifinals).

3001 | Overview
During the National Youth Cyber Defense Competition, each team competes in a series of online
competition rounds by fixing vulnerabilities, hardening systems, and performing other tasks. Teams
from the Open, All Service, and Middle School Divisions compete during the same scheduled
competition weekends but are scored only against the other teams within their divisions.
CyberPatriot operates under the premise that all coaches, technical mentors, team assistants, and
competitors conduct themselves with the highest ethical standard. The following rules have been
instituted to prevent the perception of misconduct that would jeopardize the integrity of the competition
and ensure a fair and equitable competition between all teams.
Coaches are encouraged to work with the CyberPatriot Program Office to resolve questions regarding
these rules before the competition. The following rules apply throughout the CyberPatriot competition
season, to include competitions and events outside of competition rounds that involve CyberPatriot
images or tasks. Violation of any of the rules in this chapter may lead to penalties.
3002 | Official Competition Communication
Email is the official and primary channel of communication from the CyberPatriot Program Office to
coaches. The official email addresses from which communications are sent from the CyberPatriot staff
include info@uscyberpatriot.org and/or cpoc@uscyberpatriot.org.
Email is not considered a substitute for helpdesk/technical support during a competition round. Official
competition information will be posted in the CPOC tech support chat or on the CyberPatriot website
(www.uscyberpatriot.org) if there are technical issues with the official email.
1. Competition Emails before the Round
Teams receive two competition emails before each online competition round and two emails after the
competition round. Coaches are the only individuals who receive these emails, and it is their
responsibility to ensure that each of the emails listed below is received. Copies of these emails are
also available on the coaches dashboard. Coaches should contact the CyberPatriot Program Office if
emails are not received in the time frames listed below. Failure to receive emails is not grounds for an
appeal.
A. Download and Instructions Email – On or before the Monday prior to the competition round,
coaches receive an email with image download information, as well as the following:
 Competition Round Instructions
 Image download links
 Cisco NetAcad Challenge information
 Other Challenge information
 Technical support information
B. StartEx Email – At 9:00 AM ET on the first day of the scheduled competition round, an email will
be sent to all coaches with the following information:
 Image decryption passwords
 Changes to instructions since the Download and Instructions Email
22
2. Competition Emails after the Round
A. Preliminary Score Email – This email is used for all rounds to ensure that scores are correct
before scoring or advancement information is released. It notifies coaches of their preliminary scores
from the recent round and issues a deadline for Preliminary Score Discrepancy Reports.
B. Results Email – Release of this email is contingent on a variety of factors including inquiries and
appeals. The goal for release of the email is eight working days after the completion of the
competition round. The Competition Round Results Email contains the following information:
1. A link to the scores from the just-completed competition round.
2. A link to a general list of vulnerability categories in the images. Specific vulnerabilities will not
be published. The general list of vulnerabilities categories may include:
Access control and settings – Insecure services – Policy violations: files and/or services –
Antivirus – File sharing and permissions – Login Policy – Malware – Password Policy –
Firewall – Updates – User Policy – Forensics Questions - Miscellaneous
3. Technical Support
Technical support for online competition rounds is provided by the CPOC staff during each
competition window during all competition rounds (all times Eastern).
A. Official Means for Technical Support Requests during Competition Rounds. Official requests
for technical support will be accepted only through the following means.
1. CPOC Tech Support Chat (WebEx) – This is the preferred means of technical support during
a competition round. Information for accessing the WebEx chat is included in the StartEx
Email.
2. Telephone – The CyberPatriot staff can be reached during the competition windows at +1
(877) 885-5716
B. Email. Email is not an official means of technical support during a competition round. Therefore,
technical support requests through email will not receive official consideration.
Teams should use email during a competition round to submit information only when requested by
CyberPatriot tech support. Additionally, Score Correction Requests and appeals will not be accepted
by email.
 1. Technical and scoring information and questions should be sent to cpoc@uscyberpatriot.org
(outside of competition rounds).
 2. Registration and administrative (e.g., student registration, Volunteer Dashboard password
resets, etc.) information and requests should be sent to info@uscyberpatriot.org.
 3. Emails from cpoc@uscyberpatriot.org or info@uscyberpatriot.org are intended to broadcast
critical competition information.
C. Collaboration Tools. From time to time, the CyberPatriot staff will use Cisco WebEx, Microsoft
Teams, or other collaboration tools to assist in resolving time-consuming or complicated technical
issues. Teams may also request that their approved school or organization collaboration tool be used.
23
4. Other Information and Notifications
In addition to email, information may be posted on scoring reports within the image, the CyberPatriot
website, WebEx tech support chat banner, social media pages (Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram), or
the public scoreboard.
3003 | Competition Time and Date Restrictions
1. Official Time. The official time standard for the competition is the Network Security Challenge
(images) competition scoring server time.
2. Competition Rounds
A. Competition Round – A competition round is defined as the scheduled contiguous dates the
competition is held, in which the competition challenges are exactly the same. The competition round
is typically conducted around a weekend. A competition round is further divided into windows and
periods.
B. Competition Window – A competition window is the specified time that the competition is
conducted during a competition round. In general, it is the hours when support is available for teams
to compete. Teams shall not compete outside of the competition windows designated for each round.
The designated competition windows for each competition round are listed below. They are subject to
change by the CyberPatriot Program Office. All times are Eastern Time.
Thursday 9 AM - 10 PM ET
Friday 9 AM - 11:59 PM ET
Saturday 8 AM - 11:59 PM ET
Sunday 10 AM – 8:00 PM ET
If another competition day is used outside of the originally scheduled round, then the competition
window will be 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM ET unless otherwise specified.
C. Competition Period. The competition period is the single, four consecutive hour period in which
a team completes all challenges and tasks assigned for the competition round. The coach may
choose any four consecutive hour period within one of the competition windows. Coaches do not need
to inform the CyberPatriot Program Office of when they plan to compete.
 1) Start Time. The competition period begins when a team starts the first image (in the designated
virtual machine player) within a round’s competition window. It does not begin when the Unique
identifier is entered into the image. Other images, tasks, and challenges (e.g., Cisco NetAcad
Challenge, Boeing Cyber-Physical Systems Challenge) may be started only after the first image is
opened.
 2) End Time. The competition period ends no later than four consecutive hours after the team
powers on their first image (in the virtual machine player) within a round’s competition window,
regardless of the image time or team running time indicated on the image Scoring Report page. All
challenges and tasks must end.
The following rules govern the competition period for all teams, including teams with competitors
competing separately from their homes or other locations.
24
C. Coach’s Competition Period Responsibilities
1) Youth protection is the primary responsibility of the coach. The coach will ensure that the
students compete in a safe environment.
2) While the team is participating in the CyberPatriot competition or training the coach will be
present in person or virtually for the competition period.
3) The coach shall ensure to the best of their abilities that the competitors do not participate in
online activities (e.g., hacking, gambling, etc.) that are against the CyberPatriot Competitor’s
Code of Conduct.in Appendix VI (e.g., hacking, gambling, etc.).
4) The coach is responsible for obtaining the team’s Unique Identifier and other login credentials
from the coaches dashboard.
5) The coach is responsible for registering their team in the Cisco Networking Academy and
obtaining Cisco Competition Course login credentials via the procedures published on the
coaches dashboard. It is recommended that coaches secure this information as part of
preparing for the round.
6) If applicable, the coach is responsible for checking their team’s tier (high school teams only) at
the beginning of each round to ensure that their team is using the correct images and
completing the appropriate competition tasks.
D. Competition Period Restrictions
1) A team shall have only one competition period of four consecutive-hours to complete ALL
challenges and tasks during an online competition round.
2) A team’s competition period shall not begin before a competition window or competition round
begins or ends.
3) Entering a Unique Identifier in the Set Unique Identifier utility shall be the team’s first action
when opening an image after clicking the CyberPatriot Competitor’s Agreement. The Unique
Identifier used must be the one provided to a team on the coaches dashboard and shall be
validated with the scoring server.
4) Teams shall begin their other challenges only after opening the first image. Teams shall end
all challenges and tasks before the end of the team’s competition period.
5) Teams are not allowed to open an image or competition challenge for any reason before their
competition period begins. In addition, no “sneak peeks,” or tests of the competition software
are allowed outside of downloading images, verifying their checksums, and using the provided
connection test software.
6) The times on the Scoring Report page are for reference purposes only. It is the team’s
responsibility to ensure that ALL competition challenges and tasks, including the Cisco and
Boeing challenges, are completed by the end of the competition period that begins when the
FIRST image is opened.
7) Technical issues affecting a team’s performance will not result in extra time unless the issue is
competition wide.
2. Alternate Competition Dates
A. Competition Round Extension – The National Commissioner may direct an extension to a
scheduled competition round if extreme weather or other conditions prevent many teams from
competing.
25
B. Emergency Competition Date – Only coaches or coach alternates may request an emergency
competition date for a verified emergency with an online Appeals Form. Typically, the competition
round Start-Ex email will contain a link to the Appeals Form. The approved Emergency Competition
Date for a team is based on the resource availability of the CyberPatriot staff. A team’s coach or
coach alternate must request an Emergency Competition Date through the online Appeals Form. The
form will go through the appeals process.
The CyberPatriot Program Office will not consider schedule conflicts for Emergency Competition
Date appeals. Emergency competition dates are used only for the following:
1. Severe weather or other widespread emergencies that prevent teams from competing.
2. Unplanned hospitalization of a coach that causes a team not to compete.
3. Other requests due to extreme circumstances affecting the team's ability to compete will be
considered by the CyberPatriot Program Office on a case-by-case basis.
The deadline to submit an Emergency Competition Date request is 4:00 PM ET on the Tuesday
following the first scheduled day of the original online round unless otherwise specified. Teams that do
not meet the deadline for an Emergency Competition Date will not have one, even if there is a
competition round extension.
C. Competition-Wide Round Postponement – In the event of a national or regional-level
emergency or a competition-wide issue, the National Commissioner may postpone a competition
round. The postponed competition round will occur on the weekend following the originally scheduled
competition dates (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) unless otherwise designated by the National
Commissioner. Therefore, teams should plan for the backup date in case of a postponement.
3004 | Team Numbers, Unique Identifiers and Competition Login
Credentials
Teams may not change the division in which they registered after Round 2.
Usage of the team number by anyone outside of the specific team it was assigned to is prohibited.
This includes teams or team members participating under the same coach, mentor, organization or
school under which the team number was registered.
Team Unique Identifiers (UIDs) and other credentials are located on the coaches dashboard.
Coaches will not receive unique identifiers and login credentials in competition emails. Cisco NetAcad
Challenge, the Boeing Cyber-Physical Systems Challenge, and other credentials are the responsibility
of the coach to register and retain. Instructions for obtaining other login credentials will be contained in
emails to coaches.
Coaches are encouraged to check their dashboard before the competition and make a copy of their
UIDs and other login credentials. If the coach cannot access the dashboard, they must contact the
CyberPatriot Operations Center to receive their UIDs and other credentials. Failure to access
credentials or a delay in obtaining them is not grounds for an appeal or extra time.
26
3005 | Technical Hardware and Software Specifications
The most current technical specifications for the competition are available at
https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/competition/technical-specifications.
For a successful competition, the technical specifications must be followed. Failure to meet technical
specifications is not grounds for a score appeal or extra time.
3006 | Internet Connectivity to Competition Servers and Websites
Teams are responsible for their internet connectivity for the entire time they compete. An image or
competition challenge may not be worked offline without ever connecting to the competition server. An
image or competition challenge without a valid Unique Identifier or login credentials will have a score
without a matching history, which is possible grounds for disqualification for the team using it.
1. Mandatory Website Access
A. CyberPatriot Website – Internet access to www.uscyberpatriot.org and its web pages is
mandatory for the competition. A list of websites required for the challenges is located at
https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/competition/technical-specifications
B. Coaches Dashboard – Coaches should safeguard an up-to-date screen capture or printed copy of
their team information on the coaches dashboard to mitigate a network or website outage.
2. Competing During a Network Outage
A. Continuation of Competition Challenges and Tasks. If a team experiences a network outage
during their competition period, the competitors should continue competing on their images while
waiting for network restoral. The scoring engine will track the team’s progress and report it when the
network is restored. It is the team's responsibility to have a backup plan for internet connectivity during
a local network outage.
B. Network Backup Plan – Teams should have a backup plan to compete in the event of a network
failure. The backup plan should include network access (e.g., cell phone hotspots) and an alternate
competition space (e.g., pre-arranged use of a library or a private residence with sufficient adult
supervision) if required. The alternate competition space must be deemed safe by the coach within
the policies of the school or organization.
3007 | Coach Supervision and Oversight
A. Coach Supervision of Team(s) – Coaches shall supervise their teams for the entire competition
period. The minimal required supervision is:
1. The coach is physically present when competitors are competing in person as a group.
2. If the coach cannot be present, then a Coach Alternate must be requested by the coach or
verification official and approved by the CyberPatriot Program Office.
3. CyberPatriot Distributed Team Supervision Requirements. The coach or Coach Alternate
is required to supervise their teams that compete from distributed locations. The required
minimal supervision is:
27
a. The team’s coach must speak directly in a two-way conversation with each competitor
at least once during the competition period to check on their well-being and competition
status via video or voice at least once. Chat, voicemail, or texting does not meet this
requirement. It must be real-time verbal communication.
b. The coach is virtually present or available to teams distributed and homes and other
facilities through digital, audio, or video means for the entire competition period.
c. Competitor Post-Competition Round Statement
1) The competitors must provide the coach with an electronic or hard copy of the
Competitor Post-Competition Round Statement (see Appendix VII) for each
competition round.
2) The deadline for the statements is 11:59 pm Eastern Time on the last scheduled
day of the competition round or the team’s Emergency Competition Date.
3) The team’s coach shall maintain the season’s Competitor Post-Competition Round
Statements until February 15.
B. Oversight Visits to Competition Areas and Spaces – If the need arises, coaches shall allow the
CyberPatriot competition staff and AFA officials to visit their competition areas and spaces so they
may observe the conduct of the competition and fulfill their oversight role. However, an oversight visit
does not relieve the coach of their authority and responsibilities for the team.
C. CyberPatriot Competition Staff Entry into a Competition System – During the competition, the
CyberPatriot Program Office staff may request to view teams’ systems for oversight, competition
administration, and troubleshooting purposes. CyberPatriot staff will not change teams’ systems.
Teams shall allow the competition staff immediate access to their system(s) when requested.
3008 | Competition Areas, Spaces, and Interaction with Other
Teams
A. Competition Area – A competition space is a location where one team competes within a
competition area. The competition space can be physical or virtual.
1. Control of the Competition Area – The coach (or approved coach alternate) of a team must
be present (i.e., onsite) to administer all competition rounds where teams are competing in
person as a group. For CyberPatriot 17, coaches or approved coach alternates of teams that
are distributed at homes or other facilities must be available for communication with their
competitors for the entire competition period.
2. Multiple Teams – In cases where a competition area contains multiple team spaces, coaches
or coach alternates shall take appropriate action to ensure that no purposeful or inadvertent
communication or collaboration occurs between teams. Examples of appropriate action
include keeping teams as far away from each other as possible or in separate rooms, keeping
the volume of discussions to a minimum, and ensuring that any written notes are only visible to
individual teams.
3. Approved Virtual Teams – Approved virtual teams shall follow the same rules relating to
sharing and accessing of competition images, software, and information as physical teams, to
include the single connection to an image. Virtual team competition areas and spaces must
meet the requirements of supervision and the requirements of physical competition areas and
spaces.
28
B. Competition Space – The competition space is the location where competitors of one or more
teams compete (e.g., school, home, multipurpose room, computer lab).
C. Interactions with other teams – During their competition periods, team members of different
teams competing in the same competition area shall not communicate with members of the other
teams. Independent observers monitoring the competition must not communicate with or interrupt the
competitors, or otherwise threaten the integrity of the competition or safety of the competitors.
1. Teams or their team members, Coaches, or Mentors not competing may not observe other
teams competing in physical or virtual competition spaces. This rule applies to teams that have
already competed, are competing, or will compete later. In the case of a safety issue, where
teams not competing must be in the same area as a competing team, Coaches must take
reasonable precautions to obscure from view and limit the hearing of discussions of the
competing team.
2. Teams (competitors, coaches, and mentors) shall not attempt to learn another team’s
competition information from the other team’s members, their communications, data,
documents, or systems.
3. To give coaches flexibility due to safety and other concerns, teams may compete in the
following locations.
 Teams may compete in person as a group in the same competition period.
 Team members may compete as a team distributed at homes or facilities in the same
competition period.
 Teams may compete as a hybrid of in-person or distributed at homes or facilities in the
same competition period.
Note: In all cases, a team’s competitors shall all compete in the same competition period.
3009 | Sharing of Competition Materials
Coaches are entrusted with competition round materials including images, software, documentation,
websites, and information. Coaches should treat the competition round materials as examination
material. Coaches must control images, passwords, and other competition information so that
competitors and others may use them only in the team’s competition space or competition area.
For CyberPatriot 17, Coaches may distribute competition images, software, documentation, and
information to their teams if the competitors are competing from home or other facilities. Coaches are
responsible for controlling the distribution of images, software, documentation, and information directly
to their team and shall not delegate the responsibility to the competitors.
1. Rules against sharing information
To avoid giving a competitive advantage to other teams, competitors may only share images and
other information with their team members. Furthermore, participants must:
a. Structure a competition area or use procedures so that other teams’ competitors may not gain
useful information or a competitive advantage. In competition areas where competition spaces
are in separate rooms, a team’s competitors may not enter another team’s room, except for
competitor safety, health, or protection.
29
This rule applies when a team is distributed at a home or other facility. Coaches must ensure
that their competitors’ competition spaces meet this requirement if competitors from other
teams compete in the same home or facilities.
b. Teams are not required to have only a single connection to each image. Console logins, RDP,
SSH, etc., may be used to connect to the image. However, teams having multiple instances of
the same image open at the same time is not permitted.
c. Strictly limit distribution of CyberPatriot competition and practice images and software to their
teams. Coaches shall ensure that the images and other challenge information including the
Cisco NetAcad Challenge materials (e.g., Packet Tracer submissions, copies of quizzes), and
the Boeing Cyber-Physical Systems Challenge images and materials are deleted after each
round per the competition email.
For CyberPatriot 17, Coaches may supervise the deletions of images and competition
materials with the Competitor’s Post-Competition Statement in Appendix VII. The statements
will be collected by the team’s Coach. If the CyberPatriot Program Office requests the
statements, the coach shall forward them to the CyberPatriot Program Office.
Note: All images distributed by the CyberPatriot Program Office are the property of the Air &
Space Forces Association, not CyberPatriot participants.
d. Not share information about the competition images or challenges with anyone outside of their
team. This includes not sharing information with participants of other teams from the same
school or organization.
e. Not transfer copies of images to persons who are not currently registered CyberPatriot
participants. Transfer of the images to non-CyberPatriot participants is a violation of the End
User License Agreement.
f. Work only on the images assigned to their team.
g. Ensure that images and passwords are not transferred outside of their team.
h. Not assist or provide an unfair advantage to teams that have not yet competed or are actively
competing in a given round.
i. Not post, teach, email, store, or share answered or unanswered quizzes, questions,
challenges, exercises, vulnerabilities, information from within images or competition websites
(e.g., www.netacad.com), from the competition. This includes scenarios, web pages,
readme.txt files, and other documents associated with images and challenges. Screenshots of
the images or the Scoring Report are strictly prohibited.
j. Not seek, search, request, copy, or use competition answers or work from any source that was
not created by their own team.
k. When the round is complete, users shall delete the competition images, software (e.g., Packet
Tracer) and ensure their competitors delete the competition images according to the guidance
in competition emails.
2. Examples of information sharing violations
Examples of image or information sharing violations include:
a. Passing vulnerabilities, information, or answers from a team that has competed or is
competing to a team that has not yet competed in a given round.
30
b. Posting or re-posting information on or from images, competition software, or answers on
social media, blog, or other website or through text or email -- even after a round of
competition.
c. Using an image or software from the present or a prior competition round for training.
d. Requesting answers or other competition assistance on a blog or social media.
e. Teaching or briefing an image or task’s vulnerabilities or answers to anyone who has not
competed.

3012 | Competition Image “One Instance” Rule
A team may open only one instance of each image or competition software at a time during a
competition round. An instance is defined as each time a competition image or competition software is
opened in a virtual machine player, Internet browser, or another software program. This rule also
applies to teams competing distributed from homes or other facilities.
A. Instances of Different Images – If a competition round involves more than one image or other
competition software, then only one instance of each distinct image or software may be opened at a
time. The team may not have more than one instance of either image up at the same time (as
depicted in the graphic below).
“Multiple Instance”
Rule Explanation
Computer 1 Computer 2 Computer 3
ACCEPTABLE
(No more than one copy of an image
is open simultaneously)
PENALTY
(Simultaneously running two copies
of the same image)
B. Shadowing – Shadowing, following, parallel operations, training, or any other use of a second or
more instance of an image or scoring client, online or offline, is NOT permitted.
C. Additional Compressed (NOT UNZIPPED) Image Downloads – Teams may place an additional
ZIPPED download of each image in a given round of competition on other host computers. If the host
computer fails or the original download is corrupted or deleted, the team may use this compressed
image. Coaches shall ensure that the zipped images are deleted after the competition round.
D. Re-Opening Images – A second instance of an image may be opened if only the original image is
corrupted or malfunctions. In this case, the original instance must be closed and deleted before the
team opens another instance. If the original instance is not closed, the scoring engine will show
multiple concurrent instances of the image, which is grounds for an inquiry and a penalty. The
competition period time will continue regardless of the time required for opening a new image.
E. Image Snapshots – Using image snapshots or similar capabilities are allowed for CP-XVII.
Snapshots include the use of host system file copy mechanisms to create a backup copy of an image.
Snapshots or backups may be used to roll back to a previously known good state. If the competition
34
image becomes corrupted or unusable, snapshots are an acceptable way of attempting to recover the
competition image.
3013 | Offensive Activity and Tampering
Participants shall not conduct offensive activity or tampering against other teams, competitors, the
competition systems and servers, documents, tasks, or non-participants to gain a competitive
advantage for them or others. Additionally, participants may not actively seek or exploit vulnerabilities
in images, competition systems, competition software, or tasks at any time.
Offensive activity includes:
1. Hacking.

4001 | Competition Challenges
The CyberPatriot online competition rounds contain one or more of the following scored challenges.
The National Commissioner may direct additional challenges. Competition challenges become more
difficult with each round.
1. Network Security Challenge
The Network Security Challenge is the main event during the online rounds. It is a cyber defense
event based on finding and fixing security vulnerabilities in virtual machines images. Additionally,
teams may be asked questions about the actions they took during the challenge. The CyberPatriot
Competition System (CCS) is used to score this challenge.
a. Virtual Machine Image (Image) – CCS scores teams on their discovery and remediation
of vulnerabilities in an image. A CyberPatriot image is a simulated operating system played
on a virtual machine player that contains scoring software. Specific operating system
image types will be released before the competition rounds.
b. Coach Image Responsibilities – As mentioned in a previous section, coaches shall
ensure that passwords, competition round images, and competition software are strictly
controlled. When the round is complete, coaches shall delete the competition images and
ensure their competitors delete the competition images according to the guidance in
competition emails. Coaches may maintain the team’s saved scoring data until the result of
an appeal or inquiry is published and then delete the data.
c. Accurate Host Computer Time – Host computer clocks must be set to the correct local
time zone, time, and date. Teams should check these factors before competing and NOT
change the host computer time or date once a round has begun. Teams can use
https://www.time.gov to check their local clock.
d. CyberPatriot Competition System (CCS) – CCS is an Internet-dependent competition
system used for the online competition Rounds. CCS uses a client-based scoring system
based on scored security vulnerabilities that are fixed, remediated, or identified in an
image. It is possible to reduce a score if a fix to one vulnerability undoes a previous fix, or if
a team is assessed a penalty for an action that makes a system less secure or conflicts
with the scenario for that Round. Points lost to penalties can be recovered by way of
corrective action. Not all vulnerabilities in an image are scored.
2. Cisco Networking Academy (NetAcad) Challenge
The Cisco NetAcad Challenge is a timed event administered by Cisco Systems in which teams
answer questions regarding networking and complete virtual networking challenges with the Cisco
Packet Tracer software. Middle School Division teams will participate in Cisco NetAcad Challenges for
score starting in the Introductory Round.
a. Cisco Networking Academy Website – All Open, All Service, and Middle School Division
coaches and technical mentors can gain access to this site at the beginning of the
competition season. All networking challenges during the online rounds take place on this
site.
Note: Competitors under 13 years of age are permitted to access the Cisco Networking
Academy online only with the permission of their parent or guardian. Coaches must ensure
38
that the parent or guardian of the competitor has given their permission for their child to
use the Cisco Networking Academy website.
b. Scoring – The networking quizzes are immediately scored upon submission, while the
virtual networking Packet Tracer exercises are manually scored by the Cisco engineers.
They are then weighed with the Network Security Challenge per the Competition
Challenges document.
3. Other Challenges
The National Commissioner may direct other challenges during the competition season. Challenges
may or may not be announced in advance of a competition round.
4. National Finals Competition
The National Finals Competition is an in-person competition round held in Bethesda, Maryland. The
National Finals Competition includes a Red Team (attacker) activity and more challenges than the
online rounds.
A separate document is published after the Semifinals that covers rules specific to the National Finals
Competition. Until this season’s document is released, teams should assume that all rules governing
behavior in the online rounds hold true unless the conflict with rules in the National Finals document.
The CyberPatriot Program Office will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and keep teams
informed on plans for the National Finals Competition with the health and safety of the teams that
qualify as the top priority for determining the best path forward.
4002 | Scoring
1. Score-Governing Rules
The following rules govern scoring for all online rounds of competition at all skill levels (tiers) in all
divisions.
A. Network Security Challenge – Scores are based on the number of security vulnerabilities fixed or
remediated and questions about actions taken on images. It is possible to reduce a score if an action
undoes the protection of a previous fix.
B. Cisco NetAcad Challenge – Scores are based on team performance in quizzes and/or virtual
networking activities.
C. Boeing Cyber-Physical Systems Challenge -- Scores are based on team performance solving
issues and protecting data and networks.
D. Other Factors – Percentages, difficulty, number of vulnerabilities fixed, or other weighting factors
will NOT be used to calculate scores in the Qualification Rounds and will NOT be considered in the
advancement of teams to any competition round.
E. Weighting – The Network Security Challenge will be the most heavily weighted event even in
rounds that include a Cisco NetAcad Challenge and other challenges.
39
F. Administrative Penalties – Penalties may be applied to teams’ scores for rules and conduct
violations
G. Tiebreakers – If teams have a tie score that affects their advancement to a State Round tier or the
Semifinals, all tied teams will advance.
State Awards. If teams have a tie score that affects the outcome of a State Award, the following
tiebreakers (in order) will be used to resolve the tie in this order:

1. Highest score in the State Round Network Security Challenge (Images)
2. Highest total score in the Qualification Rounds
3. Highest total Round 2 or Introductory Round score
4. Fastest time to the team’s final State Round Network Security Challenge score. The
CyberPatriot Competition System scoring server time is the official time.
Semifinals Awards. If teams have a tie score that affects the outcome of a Semifinals Award, the
following tiebreakers (in order) will be used to resolve the tie in this order:

1. Highest score in the Semifinals Network Security Challenge (Images)
2. Highest total score in the State Round
3. Highest total Round 2 or Introductory Round score
4. Fastest time to the team’s final Semifinals Network Security Challenge score. The
CyberPatriot Competition System scoring server time is the official time.
National Finals Competition Advancement. If teams have a tie score that affects their advancement to
the National Finals Competition, or if teams have a tie score that affects the outcome of an award, the
following tiebreakers (in order) will be used to resolve the tie in this order:
1. Highest score in the Semifinals Network Security Challenge (Images)
2. Highest total score in the State Round
3. Highest total score in the Qualification Rounds
4. Highest total Round 2 or Introductory Round score
5. Fastest time to the team’s final Semifinal Network Security Challenge score. The CyberPatriot
Competition System scoring server time is the official time.
National Commissioner’s Tiebreaker Determination. In the event that a tie cannot be broken with the
methods listed, a coin toss or other method designated by the National Commissioner shall determine
the winner.
2. Score Corrections
Only a coach or a coach alternate may submit a request to correct their team’s scores. There are two
ways to request score corrections.
1. Score Correction Request – A score correction request is an online form used by Coaches
during the scheduled competition round to request a score correction for their team. A team’s
score correction due to an administrative, technical, or scoring error requires a coach to submit an
online score correction request. The link to the online score correction request form is found in the
StartEx email. Teams will not receive an answer to their requests. Requests that are approved will
result in a team’s score modification.
40
a. Deadline – The deadline for a coach to request a score correction is 11:59 PM Eastern
Time on the day the scheduled round ends. If a team competes during a competition round
extension or on an Emergency Competition Date, the deadline for a coach to request a
score correction is 11:59 PM Eastern Time of the day in which they competed. Requests to
correct scoreboard warnings and suspected scoring issues during the round will not be
accepted after the deadline.
1) Documentation – Score Correction Requests will be submitted online without
supporting documentation. The CyberPatriot Program Office will request
documentation as needed. However, coaches who document a scoring error may
expedite the correction process and further their team’s case. Valuable documentation
includes the following.
a. Scoring Files – Scoring data stored on the Windows images
(C:\CyberPatriot\ScoringData folder) and the Ubuntu images
(/opt/CyberPatriot/) is the best documentation to prove a scoring error. The data
may be copied from the image and emailed to the CyberPatriot Program Office.
To ensure that an image is not damaged, coaches should copy the data and
not remove or alter it.
b. Full-Screen Capture of the Scoring Report Page* – If the scoring report
page's screen capture is cut off or modified, it will likely not be considered. The
screen capture should be easily readable and include: CyberPatriot Logo,
Report Generated Time, Current Unique Identifier, Known Issues Fixed,
Penalties Assessed, Score, Copyright Information, and Connection Status.
*NOTE: Screen captures of the Scoring Report are to be submitted to
CyberPatriot and then deleted before the next competition Round. It is a rules
violation to keep a screenshot of the Scoring Report for reasons other than
score discrepancy disputes.
c. Competition Scoreboard Screenshot – Complete screenshots are helpful,
but not required.
2. Preliminary Score Discrepancy Report – After the online round is complete, preliminary scores
are published. At that time, only coaches or coach alternates may submit an online Preliminary
Score Discrepancy Report. The report is for a discrepancy in the preliminary scores only. It is not
a means of submitting technical issues that should have been submitted in a Score Correction
Request. Coaches may not use the report to report administrative, technical, or scoring errors
during the online round. Discrepancies that coaches may note on the form include incorrect
scores, penalties, team number mix-ups, overtime, and multiple instances. The link to the online
Preliminary Score Discrepancy Report form is found in the Preliminary Scores email.
a. Deadline – The deadline for a coach to submit a Preliminary Score Discrepancy Report is
published in the preliminary score email following the round. It is typically one to two working
days after the preliminary scores are published. Requests to correct scores will not be
accepted after the deadline.
3. Appeals Process
The appeals process is a formal procedure that ensures competition fairness by considering
unforeseen conditions that impact a team’s ability to compete. The process is NOT a vehicle for a
team to pursue advancement in the competition by other means. Appeals include requests for
Emergency Competition Dates. Appeals will be submitted through the online Appeals Form, which is
published in the competition round emails. The following rules apply to appeals. The National
Commissioner is the final decision authority on all appeals.
41
A. Deadlines – Unless otherwise published by the CyberPatriot Program Office, appeals must be
received by the CyberPatriot Program office before 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Tuesday after the
start of the round.
B. Originator – Only the team’s coach or coach alternate may originate a team’s appeal.
C. Grounds Not Considered for Appeals
 Issues stemming from using other virtualization software or versions other than the version of
the virtual machine player as published on the technical specifications page on the
CyberPatriot website.
 Failure to receive competition email
 Ignorance of the original competition round dates
 Failure to secure a coach alternate
 Failure to access the competition space
 Scheduling conflicts
 Internet connectivity issues that are not due to uncontrollable circumstances
 Failure to properly work out connectivity issues with the IT department (e.g., firewall
exceptions, using the Connection Test software)
 Hot spot or air card failure
 Issues caused by changing default virtual machine player settings (e.g., memory, processors).
 Coach or team-caused use of incorrect Unique Identifiers or Cisco Login Credentials after the
first Qualification Round.
 Issues related to the use of non-Windows host systems (For compatibility issues, teams
should have access to at least one Windows host computer that meets hardware and software
technical specifications.).
 Issues related to Windows host computers and software that do not meet technical
specifications listed in the Rules Book or competition email (e.g., no 64-bit system, virtual
technology disabled, etc.)
D. Scored Vulnerability Fixes or Remediation – Any appeal concerning an alternative scored
vulnerability fix or an alternative remediation method must be certified by the registered coach. The
appeal must be first reported in the Score Correction Request, or it will not be considered. If the
appeal is determined to be valid, the coach or coach alternate must certify it on the Appeals Form.
Failure to score points through the use of a script(s) will not be considered.

1. A statement certifying that the team members did not read, discuss, overhear, post, or
otherwise receive, share, or publicize the vulnerability fix or remediation with any other team to
include those in the same organization or school or those teams coached by the same coach.
2. A statement certifying that the team actually tried the fix or remediation that is the subject of
the appeal
3. A description of how the team found out about the scored vulnerability.
4. A full and detailed description of the commands and actions taken to fix or remediate the
vulnerability.
E. Format and Documentation – Appeals are submitted in the online Appeals Form which is found in
the Start-Ex email. All appeals must be supported with appropriate documentation (e.g., letters from
school principal and news report outlining school or organization closures). Documents cannot be
provided via the online form must be emailed to cpoc@uscyberpatriot.org before the deadline for
appeals.
42
F. Notification of Results – The CyberPatriot Program Office will email the coach the results of their
appeals.
4. Results Publication
The results or links to the results of competition rounds will be published in the following media.
1. The CyberPatriot website: www.uscyberpatriot.org
2. Competition Round Results Email
Coaches may receive a courtesy copy of the Results Email within an hour before the results are
published on the CyberPatriot website. To allow coaches to notify their teams of their results, the
CyberPatriot Program Office requests that participants do not post the results on social media sites
before they are posted on the CyberPatriot website.
4003 | Penalties
Any and all of the penalties below may be applied for any violations of the rules in this document,
including misconduct:
1. Minor Penalties
In the event of a minor rule violation, the National Commissioner may impose competition penalties on
a team including:
 Score reduction.
 Time disadvantage in future competition rounds.
 Invalidation of a team’s competition round score.
2. Major Penalties (Disqualification)
If the National Commissioner rules that a participant or team committed a major rules violation, they

sole discretion of the National Commissioner.
3. Other Penalties
Other penalties invoked by the National Commissioner may affect a team’s final score or
advancement. A team or participant that does not cooperate in an inquiry may incur a penalty to
include the disqualification, suspension, or ban of an individual or team as determined by the National
Commissioner.
43
4. Replacement Teams
If a team that has advanced to the National Finals Competition is suspended, unable to compete, or
banned, a replacement team may be chosen at the discretion of the National Commissioner. In the
event the National Commissioner decides to designate a replacement team, the following criteria will
be considered:
 The team that would have next qualified to advance per the competition rules but did not
advance.
 Teams that did not compete in the Platinum Tier State Round in their respective division shall
not be considered for the National Finals Competition.
 If a designated replacement team did not respond with the information required for the
competition or to support its logistics when requested, the National Commissioner may revoke
the designation of the replacement team.
4004 | Advancement
The following subparagraphs detail the differences in advancement between the Open, All Service,
and Middle School Divisions.
Note that geographical areas recognized in the competition for awards and advancement are U.S.
states, Canada, and the At-Large teams. The At-Large teams are considered one group and it
consists of teams from the U.S. territories and teams located in other nations, including Department of
Defense Education Activity schools.
1. Open Division Advancement
The graphic below depicts team advancement for the Open Division.
A. Round 1 – Round 1 is a qualification round. All teams may participate in this round.
B. Round 2 – Round 2 is a qualification round. All teams may participate in this round regardless of
their participation in Round 1.
44
C. State Round – All teams are eligible to participate in the State Round regardless of their
participation in Rounds 1 and 2; however, they must compete within their assigned skill tier (Platinum,
Gold, or Silver). The Platinum Tier is more challenging than the Gold Tier, which is more challenging
than the Silver Tier. Tier placement is permanent for the remainder of the season. Teams may not be
promoted or demoted between tiers and may not self-select tiers.
1. Platinum Tier – Top 30% of Open Division teams based on cumulative Round 1 and Round 2
scores. Highest ranking tier, and the only tier eligible to qualify for the National Finals
Competition. Always outranks the Gold Tier.
2. Gold Tier – Middle 40% of Open Division teams based on cumulative Round 1 and Round 2
scores. Ineligible to qualify for National Finals Competition. Always outranks the Silver Tier.
3. Silver Tier – Remaining 30% of Open Division teams based on cumulative Round 1 and
Round 2 scores. Ineligible to qualify for National Finals Competition.
Advancement to Semifinals is based solely on a team’s State Round score.
D. Semifinals – Only the top 25% of teams (within each skill tier) advance to the Semifinals based on
State Round scores. If a specific state, Canada, or the At-Large Region is not represented by a team
advancing in the top 25%, the single highest scoring team from that state will advance as a wildcard.

4005 | Awards
Teams may earn recognition for their performance in the State and Seminal Rounds. A list of award
winners is published with the scores on the CyberPatriot website.
1. AFA State Awards
Teams must compete in the state round to be eligible for a state award. AFA State Awards are higher
ranking than State Tier awards, because they recognize top teams from the entire pool of division
teams within the state
A. Open Division – The top three teams overall in each state, Canada, and the At-Large region are
mailed a hard-copy AFA State Awards based on their State Round score. *
B. All Service Division – The top three teams overall (regardless of category) in each state, Canada,
and the At-Large region are mailed a hard-copy AFA State Awards based on their State Round
score.*
47
*Because the level of difficulty varies between tiers at the high school level and scores are not adjusted for
difficulty, Platinum Tier teams always rank higher than Gold Tier teams, which always rank higher than Silver
Tier teams. See the example below:
C. Middle School Division – The top three teams overall in each state, Canada, and At-Large region
receive a hard-copy AFA State Awards based on their cumulative Introductory Round and State
Round scores.

Appendix I | Coach Agreement
Coaches are vital to the success of CyberPatriot. Without coaches’ voluntary partnership,
CyberPatriot will never be able to expand to the tens of thousands of schools and students who are
eager to participate – and whom our nation needs. The CyberPatriot coach serves in two roles. The
coach (with additional assistance at her/his sole discretion) guides the team through preparation for
the competition. As importantly, the coach is a critical member of the CyberPatriot management team
who ensures:
1. Access to minor competitors in a way that protects them and respects parental prerogatives;
and
2. The integrity of the competition during online and in-person competitions.
As a CyberPatriot coach, I agree to uphold the highest standards of integrity, sportsmanship, honesty,
and good citizenship. I will encourage my team to compete fairly, honestly, and with a constructive
attitude that celebrates our successes as well as those of other teams.
Access To Competitors
1. Coordinate parental notification and permissions to allow their minor children to participate in
the program per the current “CyberPatriot User Agreement and Privacy Policy” published by
the Air & Space Forces Association.
2. Coordinate and provide permission for any student/cadet to register in the CyberPatriot
Competitor Relationship Management (CRM) system.
3. Coordinate, arrange, and approve involvement with the team by any technical mentor(s) or
team assistants at the coach’s sole discretion, whether in-person or online and whether
obtained from the CyberPatriot mentor database or any other source.
4. Abide by the CyberPatriot Standards of Conduct attached to this document.
5. Act as the team’s single point of contact for the CyberPatriot Program Office.
Academic Program
1. Deliver basic network security training to all assigned competitors as may be reasonably
accommodated at the coach’s sole discretion.
2. Encourage competitors to devote some time to self-study/preparation for the competition.
3. Not provide any training of offensive techniques, hacking, or social engineering as part of any
CyberPatriot training or curriculum.
NOTE: This guidance may seem too flexible, but it is intended to spark creativity. Encouraging
competitors to take a central role in team preparation (with adult guidance and involvement) enhances
both team cohesion and performance.
Competition Management
1. Select and designate primary and alternate competitors for each competition period. The
competitors for any single competition period must be assigned from competitors registered in
the CyberPatriot Competitor Relationship Management (CRM) System.
51
2. Uphold the integrity of the competition by ensuring that no more than five competitors at a time
in any particular round of the competition and those competitors do not receive assistance
from any external source.
3. Ensure that all rules of the competition as described in the CyberPatriot Rules Book and
competition emails are strictly followed.
4. Report any technical or security issues involving competition systems or tasks only to the
CyberPatriot Program Office and not widely publicize them in order to protect the systems and
tasks from exploitation.
5. Not aid or abet any competitor attempts to socially engineer, hack, or undertake any offensive
activity against competition systems, other teams, or any other party and report any instances
of this behavior to the CyberPatriot Program Office.
Competition Logistics
1. Coordinate and support all elements of the preparatory training and online competition rounds,
including arranging a competition location and obtaining necessary computer equipment for
training/Qualification Rounds of the competition.
2. Provide feedback to the CyberPatriot management team and coordinate feedback from
competitors designed to improve the entire program.
3. Agree to coordinate logistics for the trip with the CyberPatriot Program Office (all expenses
except entertainment and personal expenditures will be funded), should the team advance to
the National Finals Competition.
4. Agree to accompany the team and be responsible for supervision and guardianship during the
travel and onsite at the National Finals Competition.
I have read, understand, and agree to discharge the responsibilities described in the CyberPatriot
Coaches’ Agreement to the best of my abilities.
Signature: _________________________________________ Date: ________________

CyberPatriot is a national youth cyber education program created in the United States to help direct students toward careers in cybersecurity or other computer science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines.[1][2] The program was created by the Air Force Association (AFA).[3] It features the annual National Youth Cyber Defense Competition for high and middle school students. It is similar to its collegiate counterpart, the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC).

CyberPatriot requires teams to assume the role of cybersecurity professionals, responsible for protecting various systems in a set amount of time. The competition consists of multiple online rounds in which teams analyze virtual machines, identify vulnerabilities, and implement security measures, answer forensics questions, and secure critical services. The Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security (CIAS) is responsible for designing, developing, and supplying the technology and virtual machines used in CyberPatriot.[4] The competition assesses participants' cybersecurity knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and analytical thinking.[5]

The National Youth Cyber Defense Competition is now in its seventeenth season and is called "CyberPatriot XVII" indicating the season's competition. CyberPatriot XVII is accessible to high schools, middle schools, and accredited homeschooling programs across the United States. JROTC units of all Services, Civil Air Patrol squadrons, and Naval Sea Cadet Corps divisions may also participate in the competition. CyberPatriot also hosts two additional sub-programs: Summer CyberCamps[6] and an Elementary School Cyber Education Initiative.[7] The Northrop Grumman Foundation is the "presenting sponsor". A British spin off program is called Cyber Centurion.

History
CyberPatriot began in 2009 as a proof-of-concept demonstration at AFA's Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando, Florida.[8] Four organizations were responsible for developing the competition: the Air Force Association, the U.S. Air Force, the defense contractor SAIC, and the Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security (CIAS) at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). Eight high school teams from AFJROTC and Civil Air Patrol squadrons competed. The second phase of the program was limited to Air Force AFJROTC and Civil Air Patrol teams. Online training and qualification competitions were held during the fall of 2009 with nearly 200 teams from 44 states competing for eight slots in the first in-person National Finals Competition in February 2010, held in Orlando, Florida. The final phase of the developmental program, full national deployment, is now underway. Over 1,500 teams from all 50 states, Canada, and DoD Dependent schools overseas competed in CyberPatriot VI.[9] CyberPatriot VII began in October 2014, with over 2,100 teams registered to compete.[10] The Middle School Division was added in CyberPatriot V. CyberPatriot IX, which started in October 2016, featuring over 4,300 registered teams.[11] The previous national commissioner who had served in that position since 2008, General Bernie Skoch, then the long-time National Comissioner, retired in June 2021, and has been replaced by Acting National Commissioner Rachel Zimmerman, who has served in other leadership roles prior to her term as commissioner.

Goals and objectives
CyberPatriot is open to high school and middle school students, offering educational opportunities and a pathway to cybersecurity careers. The program increases the awareness of cybersecurity by delivering a basic education in a competitive format that enhances leadership, communication, and cooperation skills among its competitors.[12][13][14]

Classic CyberPatriot Logo (Full-Color) (Still used today in some materials, used mainly in the past mostly, most notably on CyberPatriot website)
The full-color version of the CyberPatriot logo. While primarily used in earlier materials, continues to appear in select current publications, including on the official CyberPatriot website.
Team Composition
Teams have the following members:

Coach: An approved adult leader—such as a teacher, parent, or designated supervisor—who completes the team's registration and provides oversight throughout the competition period.
Verification Official: An administrator from the participating organization who is responsible for confirming the Coach’s eligibility and approval in accordance with program requirements.
Competitors: A group of two to six students, consisting of up to five primary competitors and one alternate, who participate in the competition and complete all assigned tasks.
Technical Mentor (optional): A qualified adult volunteer who possesses technical expertise and supports the team’s preparation by offering guidance in cybersecurity concepts and competition-related skills.
Team Assistant (optional): An individual who aids the Coach with administrative duties related to team management and logistics throughout the competition season.
Each team is required to have a registered Coach, a Verification Official, and registered Competitors. Coach registration begins in the late spring to allow preparation over the summer. The qualification rounds of the competition are completed online at the teams' home locations from September to early January.[15]

Competition guidelines
The competition is a tournament structure with three divisions:

Open High School Division: Open to all public, private, parochial, magnet, charter, home schools, and special groups such as CampFire, Boys & Girls Club, Boy Scouts, Church Youth Groups, Girl Scouts, etc.
All-Service Division: Open to all JROTC Services, Civil Air Patrol squadrons, US Naval Sea Cadet Corps units. The registration fee is waived for teams competing in the All-Service Division
Middle School Division: Open to all middle schools and junior high schools which follow the same common organizations as mentioned above in the Open High School Division.
The early rounds of the competition are done online during weekends via the Internet from teams' schools or other sponsoring organizations' facilities. Before the round, teams download virtual images of operating systems with known flaws or cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each team is tasked to find the flaws while keeping specified computer functions, such as email, working. Team progress is recorded by a central CyberPatriot scoring system, known as the CyberPatriot Competition System (CCS).[16]

The scores from Qualification Rounds 1 and 2 are totaled to determine which tier a team advances to.

Platinum: Top 30% of teams. Rounds include State, Semifinals, and National Finals.
Gold: Middle 40% of teams. Rounds include State and Semifinals.
Silver: Bottom 30% of teams. Rounds include State and Semifinals.
In the Semifinals round, only the top 25% of teams and state wild cards will be eligible to compete. Only teams in the Platinum tier are eligible for the National Finals.

In CyberPatriot XIII, only three rounds were held, with Round 1 delayed due to COVID-19 to allow coaches additional time for recruitment, according to announcements from the Air Force Association. Round 3 determined the National Finalists teams that year.[17]

The Challenges that teams may face include:

Network Security Challenge, in which teams fix vulnerabilities in "images" of Operating Systems that have been purposely tampered with while protecting the virtual machines(VMs) from "Red Team" which is a group of "hackers" that will exploit vulnerabilities on the competitor's machines. The Operating Systems in CP-XVII include: Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022, Ubuntu 22, and Mint 21.
Cisco Networking Challenge, in which teams show their knowledge about Cisco Packet Tracer, and take a Cisco quiz.
CyberPatriot Web-Based Challenge, in which competitors compete in a CTF-like challenge. This challenge is currently only in the Semifinals Round.
Boeing Cyber-Physical System Challenge, in which teams are presented with an operational system that tracks and maintains flight information. This challenge is currently only in the Semifinals Round.[18][19][20]
Additional competition rules are outlined below:

The Qualification Competition begins as soon as this image is opened and ends 4 consecutive hours later, after which the score will be logged. Attempting to continue after the time limit will incur penalties. It is the coach's responsibility to ensure their team does not exceed the limit.
Only one instance of the image can be opened at any given time. Opening multiple instances of a virtual image will result in a penalty.
No person may compete on a team with which they are not registered, and may only be registered with one team per competition.
During the competition, no outside assistance may be given to or received from anyone.
No competitor may offer assistance to another after their round ends and the other begins.
No outside communication is allowed during the competition. This includes but is not limited to verbal, electronic, written or coded.
No offensive activity of any kind is permitted, including but not limited to hacking through programs or manual code injection, interfering with another team through social engineering, deception, and/or attaining the opposing machine.[15]
National Finals Competition
The highest-scoring Semifinalist teams from each division, about 28 in total, are invited to participate in the in-person National Finals Competition. This is held annually in the spring, with all travel and lodging expenses covered by the program. For CyberPatriot IV-VII, National Finals Competitions were held at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland in March. From the CyberPatriot VIII season through the CyberPatriot XI season, the National Finals Competitions moved to the Hyatt Regency Baltimore Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland, and were held in April of each year. Beginning in the CyberPatriot XII season, the National Finals Competition has been held at the Bethesda North Marriott Hotel & Conference Center in Bethesda, Maryland outside of Washington, D.C., in March. However, the CyberPatriot XII In-Person National Finals Competition, the first year planned at the Bethesda North Marriott, was canceled due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and a virtual, in-home competition was held online in May, about two months after the originally scheduled in-person competition event.[21] The CP-XII Virtual National Finals was held on May 2, 2020, and marked the first-ever online virtual CyberPatriot National Finals Competition. Due to the widespread outbreak of COVID-19, the CyberPatriot XIII season had modifications to accommodate the delay in team administration as well as provisions for additional procedures for competing at home.Due to continued COVID-19 restrictions in the United States, provisions were made to allow remote participation in the competition.

Winning teams in the Open and All-Service Divisions receive educational grants, which can be applied to an institution of their choosing. First place teams earn $2,000 per competitor, second place teams earn $1,500 per competitor, and third place earns $1,000 per competitor. The scholarship money is provided by the Northrop Grumman Foundation. In CyberPatriot VII, for first, second, and third place, an additional $2,000, $1,500, and $1,000 were awarded to the teams, respectively, by the National Security Agency
