1002 | Competition Divisions
Teams compete in three divisions: Open, All Service, and Middle School. Rules apply equally to all unless noted. Division assignments are final post-qualification, barring administrative errors. Organizations can field unlimited teams per division.
Open Division: High school students can compete on teams from approved organizations: Public/Private/Magnet/Parochial/Charter/State-chartered Virtual Schools, Home Schools, Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCA/YWCA, Scouting Units, and Other Youth Organizations*. The registering organization fields the team, and all competitors must be enrolled or directly affiliated.
All Service Division: High school students who are official members can compete on teams from: Army JROTC, Marine Corps JROTC, US Naval Sea Cadet Corps, Navy/Coast Guard JROTC (combined), Air Force/Space Force JROTC (combined), and Civil Air Patrol. These are distinct "Categories." Competitors must remain fully enrolled in their registered JROTC, CAP, or USNSCC program for the season.
Middle School Division: Middle school students can compete on teams from approved organizations: Public/Private/Magnet/Parochial/Charter/State-chartered Virtual Schools, Home Schools, Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCA/YWCA, Scouting Units, Civil Air Patrol, US Navy League Cadet Corps, and Other Youth Organizations*. The registering organization fields the team, and all competitors must be enrolled or directly affiliated.
Other Organizations and Special Requests:
Other Organizations: The National Commissioner may approve established youth organizations to field Open or Middle School teams if they have a youth program charter, mission consistent with AFA principles, a designated accountable leader, and an official minor protection policy with mandatory training. *Teams under "Other" require approval via a form sent to info@uscyberpatriot.org.
Composite Teams: The Commissioner may approve composite teams from multiple organizations if the organizations are too small to field their own teams, are not fielding other teams, and competitors belong to a common legal entity (e.g., school district) which registers the team. USNSCC/CAP composite teams need National HQ Rep concurrence. The Commissioner may also approve composite Open, CAP, or USNSCC teams with up to two middle school students if the organization cannot support a separate Middle School team, competitors belong to a common legal entity, the verification official consents, and it is the organization's only such team. *Approval is not guaranteed; email requests to info@uscyberpatriot.org.
1003 | Teams and Team Members
Teams consist of a required Coach, one-time Verification Official, and 2-6 student Competitors. Optional roles include Technical Mentors and Team Assistants.
Team Member Roles Explained

Cisco Networking Academy (NetAcad) Challenge: A timed Cisco Systems challenge with networking questions and Packet Tracer exercises. Competitors under 13 need parental permission to access the site.
Other Challenges: The Commissioner may direct additional challenges during the season.
National Finals Competition: An in-person competition that includes Red Team (attacker) activity and more complex challenges, governed by a separate rules document. Plans are subject to COVID-19 considerations.
4002 | Scoring
Scores are based on fixed vulnerabilities and challenge questions. The Network Security Challenge is most heavily weighted. Penalties may be applied for rule violations.
Tiebreakers: A detailed, sequential process breaks ties for awards and advancement, prioritizing scores from the most recent rounds and then completion times. For any remaining ties, the Commissioner designates a method.
Score Corrections: Only coaches/alternates can request corrections via two methods: a Score Correction Request (online form during the round for errors) or a Preliminary Score Discrepancy Report (online form after preliminary scores are out). Strict deadlines apply. Supporting documentation (e.g., scoring files, full Scoring Report screenshots) is valuable.
Appeals Process: This formal process, submitted by the coach via an online form, handles unforeseen issues and emergency date requests. The Commissioner's decision is final. Many grounds are not considered (e.g., connectivity issues, scheduling conflicts).
Results Publication: Final results are published on the CyberPatriot website and in a results email.
4003 | Penalties
Rule violations can result in Minor Penalties (score reduction), Major Penalties (disqualification, suspension, termination), or a Ban (permanent disqualification). Non-cooperation in an inquiry can also incur penalties. The Commissioner may select replacement teams for National Finals.
4004 | Advancement
Geographical areas include U.S. states, DC, Canada, and an "At-Large" group.
Open Division: Round 1/2 scores determine State Round tiers: Platinum (top 30%), Gold (middle 40%), Silver (bottom 30%). Tiers are permanent. Semifinals advancement is based solely on State Round scores (top 25% of each tier, plus wildcards). The top 12 Platinum teams from Semifinals advance to National Finals (max two per organization).
All Service Division: Advancement mirrors the Open Division, but tiering is within each of the six service categories. For National Finals, the top two Platinum teams from each category plus one national wildcard advance (13 total, max one per organization).
Middle School Division: All teams compete in the Introductory and State Rounds. The top 60% advance to Semifinals based on cumulative scores. The top 3 Semifinals teams advance to National Finals (max one per organization).
4005 | Awards
AFA State Awards: Hard-copy awards for the top three overall teams per state in each division. For high school divisions, Platinum Tier teams always outrank Gold/Silver, regardless of score.
State Tier Awards: Digital certificates for the top three Gold and Silver Tier teams per state.
Semifinal Awards: All qualifiers receive a digital certificate, with additional recognition for top performers.
National Finals Awards: All finalists receive a hard-copy certificate, with trophies for the top three teams in each division. Additional awards or scholarships may be presented.
